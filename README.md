## WHAT IS INHERITANCE IN  PostgreSQL❓

In programming inheritance refers to the ability of an object to take on one or more characteristics from other classes of objects. The characteristics inherited are usually instance variables or member functions. An object that inherits these characteristics is known as a subclass.
In PostgreSql it's no diferent, it allows the capacity of having child tables like in any other POO language.
